# GitHub Push Instructions

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account
2. A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

## Creating a Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Go to GitHub and sign in to your account
2. Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner and select "Settings"
3. Scroll down to "Developer settings" in the left sidebar
4. Click on "Personal access tokens" and then "Tokens (classic)"
5. Click "Generate new token" and then "Generate new token (classic)"
6. Give your token a descriptive name
7. Select the following scopes:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
8. Click "Generate token"
9. **IMPORTANT**: Copy your token immediately and save it somewhere secure. You won't be able to see it again!

## Pushing Your Project to GitHub

We've created a Python script to make pushing to GitHub easy. Follow these steps:

1. Make sure you're in the project directory
2. Run the push script:
   ```
   python push_to_github.py
   ```
3. Enter your GitHub username when prompted
4. Enter a repository name (or press Enter to use the default name "book-look")
5. Enter your GitHub Personal Access Token when prompted (it won't be visible as you type)
6. The script will:
   - Initialize a Git repository if needed
   - Add all files
   - Commit changes
   - Create a new repository on GitHub
   - Push your code to GitHub

7. Once complete, you can visit your repository at: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME`

## Manual Push (Alternative Method)

If you prefer to use Git commands directly:

```bash
# Initialize Git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit with database fixes"

# Add remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

You'll need to authenticate with your GitHub username and Personal Access Token.
